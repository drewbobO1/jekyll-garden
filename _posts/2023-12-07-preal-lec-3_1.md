## Terms:
- Term: something separated by a + or -

`4y``3 ``- 3xy + x - 9`
- In the above, there are 4 terms
	1. 4y3
	2. -3xy
	3. x
	4. -9
- Terms take the sign in front (to the left) of them

- Constant terms: unchanged terms (no variable)
- Variable terms: term that can change depending on the number plugged in

- Every variable term has a coefficient and a variable part

|  **Variable term**<br/> | Coefficient<br/> | Variable part<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  4y3<br/> | 4<br/> | y3<br/> |
|  -3xy<br/> | -3<br/> | xy<br/> |
|  x<br/> | 1 (hidden coefficient)<br/> | x<br/> |
|  -x<br/> | -1 (hidden coefficient)<br/> | x<br/> |

## Combining like terms:
- Like terms: terms with the same variable part
	- That means the same variable, raised to the same exponent
- Any constant terms are automatically like terms (due to the lack of coefficients

`13ab + 4 - 3ab - 10`
- In the above, 13ab and -3ab are like terms
	- As well as the constants 4 and -10

`2xy + 9yx`
- The above are like terms as well, due to the **commutative property of multiplication**

- Terms can be combined by **adding the coefficients of like terms**
	- When combining like terms, the variable part does not change

## Multiplication
- To multiply a constant by a variable term (or vice versa), multiply by the coefficient
	- Keep the variable part, but this gets the correct coefficient.

See example:
`5(4x) -> (5 * 4) * x -> 20 * x -> ``20x``
`

## Distribution
- Distributive property: as long as you multiply the outside term by each of the inside terms, you’ll get the same answer
	- Outside factor by each of the inside terms
- This works not only with numbers, but also “in general”
- See here for quick explanation (1:20:40 lc 3.1)

See example
`2(3 + 4) -> (2 * 3) + (2 * 4) -> 6 + 8 -> 14`
Works just the same “in general” (i.e., for variables?)
`a(b + c) -> (a * b) + (a * c)`
- To understand why this works, see the associative property of multiplication 
	- See this note and this clip

	- Basically, multiplication doesn’t care how numbers are grouped

_Reminder: when distribution involves variables, multiply the coefficients_

When distributing any number (especially negative), it’s important to distribute *with the sign*
`-4(x - 2y) -> (-4 * x) - (-4 * 2y) -> -4x - (-8y) -> -4x + 8y``
`
- There’s a shortcut to get to the same answer without all the intermediate steps: 
	1. Treat what’s in the parentheses as positive/negative rather than plus/minus
	2. Distribute with that understanding
	3. Read the answer with plus/minus again

For the previous example
`-4(x - 2y)`
- That would be:
	- “negative 4 times positive x” which outputs: -4x
	- “negative 4 times negative 2y” which outputs: +8y
- This gives us the same answer of: -4x + 8y
	- Which is now read as “negative 4x plus (positive) 8y”
		- The actual correct answer; reached via the above shortcut
